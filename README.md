# Polybar Minimal Nord Theme

I want a minimal setup for polybar that use [nord palettes](https://www.nordtheme.com/), so I take the shade preset from [adi1090x/polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes#shades) and change it to fit [my setup](https://github.com/Wabri/dotfiles).

This is the main bar:

This is the second bar:

I leave even modules not used in my configuration, you never know.

## Install

Simply clone this repo to .confg/polybar:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Wabri/polybar-minimal-nord-theme.git ~/.config/polybar
```
